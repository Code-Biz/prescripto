"type": "commonJS/module" in package.json -> Tells Node.js how to treat .js files in your project. commonJS is older format that uses require & module.exports where as module uses import and export just like in frontend, for importing and exporting funtions and module (like python modules)


This is literally the entire lifecycle of data from clicking a button in React → getting processed → showing the result on screen. Every React-Express app works on this principle.
// Frontend (React)
//     ↓ fetch / axios
// Server listening at specific port after started
//     ↓ request is received at a specific API endpoint via the port
// API Endpoint (/api/users) located in the Routes folder links to a specific controller/function to run some business logic  --->  PART OF BACKEND, LOCATED IN THE ROUTES FOLDER. The endpoint Links to the correct Controller Function
//     ↓
// Backend Logic (Express)      --->  PART OF BACKEND, FUNCTIONS LOCATED IN THE CONTROLLERS FOLDER
//     • Query database
//     • Apply filters / auth / calculations
//     • Prepare data in JSON format
//     ↓
// Response (JSON)              --->  PART OF BACKEND 
//     ↓
// Frontend receives data       ---> Now can render in React component




// Controllers : This folder contains Functions that control request to and response from database. These funcs handle the business logic
// Middlewares : This folder contains Functions that run before controllers to process requests.
// Models: This folder contains DB SChemas and Models
// Routes: This folder contains Url endpoints linked to controllers

//Quick tip to know where to add what:
Does it store data? → model
Does it do DB / business logic? → controller
Does it protect / modify request? → middleware
Does it map URL to action? → route
Does it configure the app? → config







| Feature         | CommonJS            | ES6 Modules     |
| --------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| Import          | `require()`         | `import`        |
| Export          | `module.exports`    | `export`        |
| Default export? | Yes (1 main export) | Yes             |
| Modern?         | Older               | Modern standard |

If you see:

import something from ...
→ That file used export default.

If you see:

import { something } from ...
→ That file used export const.

If we have to use some dynamic variable names (varaibles whovalue can change) in a string then we use template literals for those vaaraibles.
-> string + dynamic_variable_name = use template literals. i.e hint: if it changes->use backticks
